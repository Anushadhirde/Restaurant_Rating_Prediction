# Restaurant-Rating-Prediction
 
## Objective
Build a machine learning model to predict the
aggregate rating of a restaurant based on other features.

## Steps

Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values,
encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data
into training and testing sets.

Select a regression algorithm (e.g., linear regression,
decision tree regression) and train it on the training data.

Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate
regression metrics (e.g., mean squared error, R-squared)
on the testing data.

Interpret the model's results and analyze the most
influential features affecting restaurant ratings.
